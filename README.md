# Python algorithms

The document contains algorithm problems I tackled and optimized to prepare for technical interviews at tech companies and my roadmap to learning Python.

## Study Plan

#### Part 1: Python Syntax

> The first step is to learn and familiarize with Python's basic syntax

- I watched _MIT's OpenCourseWare_, completed the course work _problem sets_ and referred to Python's official _documentations_
     - [MIT OpenCourseWare Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAcTmDO6NTI&list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB)
     - [MIT Problem Sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/lists/problem-sets/)
     - [Python Official Documentations](https://docs.python.org/3/)

#### Part 2: Readings

> Books are especially handy for developing your interview skills, understanding the hiring process of different tech companies and learn about design solutions

- I read through [**System Design Inteview - An insider's guide**](https://www.amazon.ca/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF)
- and [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SM9QG5KWAK4Q&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MYdS5W4Zz9WfX3p1X37wDReXw0onsIUDKIvrSWUZq6RvZ93kjiLSeQ_RIX6ZB19bzoa9teRw_FaEiAzZ4ya1rHQwB399ZW779Co9Nd4BKH6PZi24109LIR_es9NhQOlTVR11kV_B7jtA7UQFr4fc0vuK8ZyGj71thRGMc3Po6d-9KDXMAc-IAo4ndDHAimid1FwCu3-CgeWSu2ecKf0QFO2IJJdO2gq5ZE2PHMxgsg4.nFPTW8C1KpaTQGjYq4vnpB97MEgSaY3AXXMi9uTC1cY&dib_tag=se&keywords=Cracking+the+Coding+Interview&qid=1726528292&s=books&sprefix=cracking+the+coding+interview%2Cstripbooks%2C102&sr=1-1)

#### Part 3: Algorithm Training

> For technical interviews, take some time to improve algorithm skills, learn about data structures and algorithm types

- Go to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) or any other similiar sites to solve problems
