# Python algorithms

The document contains algorithm problems I tackled and optimized to prepare for technical interviews at tech companies and my roadmap to learning Python.

## Study Plan

#### Part 1: Python Syntax

> The first step is to learn and familiarize myself with Python's basic syntax

- I watched _MIT's OpenCourseWare_ and completed their _problem sets_
- I also referred to Python's official _documentations_
     - [MIT's OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAcTmDO6NTI&list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB)
     - [problem sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/lists/problem-sets/)
     - [documentations](https://docs.python.org/3/)

#### Part 2: Readings

> Another source of information are books, these are handy for developing your interview skills and understanding the hiring process of different tech companies

- Read **System Design Inteview** and **Cracking the Coding Interview**

#### Part 3: Algorithm Training

> At this point, it's about putting skills into practice and honing my ability to solve algorithms and recognizing specific algorithm types to optimize solutions

- Go to _Leetcode_, _geeksforgeeks_ or any other similiar sites to solve problems
     - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
     - [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
