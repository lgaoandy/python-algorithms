Why am I the bad guy?
Maybe I wanna be the hero sometimes
So used to people treating me like I'm evil
Yeah, no one ever wants to play nice
I just wanna be the good guy
But every time I try, someone loses their life
Maybe I wasn't born to be a hero, I should be evil
Well, fuck it, I'll try it
Monster (monster)
Demon (demon)
Savage (savage)
Heathen (heathen)
If I'm no (if I'm no) hero (hero)
Maybe I should be a super villain
Maybe I should be a super villain
Maybe I should be a super villain
Maybe I should be a super villain
I've been fucked up
Time to give into my demons
Heartless, bad blood
Like Medusa undo ya, ice-cold like the Queen of Hearts, of hearts
Got a head full of snakes now they all gonna pay
I'm done (I'm done)
Yeah, I'ma be a
Monster
Demon
Savage
Heathen
If I'm no hero (hero)
Maybe I should be a super villain (villain, no, no)
Maybe I should be a super villain

Maybe I should be a super villain

Maybe I should be a super villain
